- Accent color: An analogous violet (#8B5CF6) for interactive elements.
- Font pairing: Use 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. These fonts give a modern, functional, and highly readable appearance that would be perfect for this application.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying any inline code or code blocks.
- Consistent use of minimalist icons from Font Awesome to represent various functions and data types.
- Employ a grid-based layout for consistent alignment and responsive design.
